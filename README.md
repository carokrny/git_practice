#Hello Git and GitHub
---
A (very) simple project to learn through practice the functionality and syntax of Git, GitHub, and Markdown. 

##Skills Learned: 
+ Use the command line to navigate and create directories, and create and modify files. 
+ Use Git from the command line to initialize a repository, stage, and commit files. 
+ Use GitHub to create a remote repository and push commits. 
+ Use Markdown to create a formatted README file.
